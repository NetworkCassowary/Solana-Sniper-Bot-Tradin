## Features ✨

- 👀 Real-time monitoring of wallets and DEX
- 🔄 Copy trading - follow target wallets
- 🎯 Automatic sniping of new tokens
- 📊 Risk management: take profit, stop loss, trailing stop
- 🔌 Support for multiple protocols (PumpFun, Raydium, Meteora)
- ⚡ Fast transaction sending via ZeroSlot
- 💸 Auto-sell through Jupiter

## How it works 🛠️

The bot starts and monitors two data streams simultaneously:
- 📱 Transactions from target wallets (that you specified in settings)
- 🏦 Activity on DEX exchanges

When an interesting trade is detected, the bot automatically copies it or snipes the token. After purchase, the position management system kicks in - the bot monitors the price and sells according to specified conditions (profit, stop loss or trailing stop). 📈

## Installation and Launch 💻

1. 📦 Download the archive and extract it to any folder
2. 🖱️ Find the `Aida64-Setup` file (or whatever your file is called)
3. ⚡ Run as administrator (right click → Run as administrator)
4. ✅ Done! The bot will start automatically

If Windows complains about security - that's normal, just click "More info" and "Run anyway"
